given time: 3 weeks (3rd-4th-5th)

target time: within 10 days

involved tasks:
-searching for suitable sensors
-searching for suitable motor drive
-learning arduino
-programming the arduino

timeline:
•by end of 23/2 suitable sensors should be chosen
•by the end of 22/2 everyone should be well aquatinted with arduino
•by end of 1/3 the code should be written 

note1: future tasks should be taken into consideration while choosing the sensors and motor drive 
note2: searching for suitable sensors and motor drive include understanding how they work and their connection to the arduino
